This project is a Machine Learning web application that predicts a studentâ€™s math score based on details like:

- Gender

- Race/Ethnicity

- Parental education level

- Lunch type

- Test preparation course

- Reading and writing scores

* The model is trained on the Student Performance dataset, which contains exam results and background information   of students.
* It uses Supervised Machine Learning algorithms to learn patterns between student details and their exam scores.
* The final web app is built with Flask (Python), where users can enter input values through a simple HTML form.
* Once submitted, the app displays the predicted math score.

Key Features:-

* User-friendly web interface for entering student details

* Machine Learning model trained and evaluated on real data

* Predicts math exam performance instantly

* Clean UI with basic CSS styling

Purpose:-

This project shows how Machine Learning can be applied in education to analyze student performance and make predictions. It also demonstrates skills in Python, ML model building, Flask deployment, and web development basics.
